## Business Rules & Logic

### Validation Rules
- **API Key Validation**: API keys must be properly formatted and have appropriate permissions
- **Time Range Validation**: Start time must be before end time, and within available historical data
- **Parameter Validation**: Strategy parameters must be within valid ranges
- **Order Validation**: Orders must have valid price and quantity values

### Calculations & Algorithms
- **Moving Average Calculation**: 
  ```
  MA = sum(prices) / period
  ```
- **RSI Calculation**: 
  ```
  RS = average_gain / average_loss
  RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
  ```
- **Profit Calculation**: 
  ```
  For long positions: profit = (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price * 100 - commission
  For short positions: profit = (buy_price - sell_price) / sell_price * 100 - commission
  ```
- **Wallet Update Calculation**: 
  ```
  For long positions: wallet = initial_wallet * (current_price / buy_price)
  For short positions: wallet = initial_wallet * (buy_price / current_price)
  ```

### Automated Processes
